### Overview

This is a single page chat application for every signed-up user. Once you create an account, you automatically have access to the chat room.

It is a practice project for learning how to integrate firebase tools into a flutter project.

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) from google that simplifies app development. In this project, we implemented a few of the tools and services that firebase provides, e.g firestore, firebase auth, firebase storage.
